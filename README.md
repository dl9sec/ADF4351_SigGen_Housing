# Housing for the "ADF4351 RF Sweep Signal Source Generator Board 35M-4.4G"
Currently there are ADF4351 35..4400MHz synthesizer boards with STM32 MCU and TFT touch display available at [ebay](https://www.ebay.de/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=ADF4351+RF+Sweep+Signal+Generator+Source+35M-4.4G+STM32+TFT) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=ADF4351+RF+Sweep+Signal+Generator+Source+35M-4.4G+STM32+TFT).

I created a 3D printable housing for this device (created with [FreeCAD 0.18](https://www.freecadweb.org/)).
The straight SMA connectors were replaced by 90Â° angled SMA connectors.

After printing (e.g. with PLA, 0,2mm per layer), M3 theads must be cut into the corner holes of the housing.
To fix the rear cover with the housing, I used M3x16 recessed countersunk flat headscrews.
